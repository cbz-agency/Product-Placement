# 📘 MVP Product Specification Document — Product Placement with Nano Banana

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overview:** A web-based tool where a user can upload a product image, and the system will automatically composite it into the hands of a model image generated via the Nano Banana API.

**Problem Statement:** Product mockups are time-consuming — designers often need to Photoshop products into lifestyle photos. Small teams/marketers want a quick, automated way to preview products in realistic settings.

**Solution:** Upload a product → system calls Nano Banana API to generate a model image → product placed into model’s hands → instant preview and download.

**Target Market:** Marketers, small e-commerce sellers, indie brands that need fast lifestyle mockups without paying for full shoots.

## 2. Product Vision

**Mission Statement:** “Make product mockups instant, simple, and accessible.”

**Long-Term Goals:**
- Phase 1: Use Nano Banana API to generate a model and insert a product into hands.
- Phase 2: Support multiple poses and placements (e.g., tabletop, shelves).
- Phase 3: AI-driven automatic context/background generation.

**Strategic Alignment:** Start lean with one model generated via Nano Banana API and one use case → validate → expand with more variations and placements.
